Hello! I'm Mills Myntti Selkregg. 
I'm a 23 year old living just north of Seattle, WA. 
I'm originally from the midwest - I grew up in Chicago, went to undegrad in Minneapolis, and now am a grad student through Colorado State.
I'm getting my masters in Data Analytics with a focus in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Outside of work, I have many passions. I'm a certified nutrition coach, and am fascinated by the impact nutrition has on endurance athletes.
I am a certified yoga instructor, and find that the right language is vital for connecting two people in understanding. 
As my love language is cooking, I am involved in the local food scene and have worked every job behind the counter in a restaurant. 
I spend my weekends trail running, rock climbing, practicing yoga, doing homework, cooking, and reading science fiction short stories.

I'm new to GitHub and am excited to be part of the coding community.
