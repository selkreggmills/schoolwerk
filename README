Hello! 
This is a collection of work from my graduate studies in Data Analysis, with a specialization in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My expected graduation date is December, 2021. 

I primarily use Python, though previous work has been in R. Currently, through NASA, I spend the majority of my time in MATLAB.
